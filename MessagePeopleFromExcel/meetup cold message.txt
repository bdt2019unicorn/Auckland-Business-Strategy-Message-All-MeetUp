Hi there, 
I am in your Tech Start-up Group. 
I am a software developer with 3 years of experience in front-end languages, PHP/C#/Java back-end languages and SQL database. 
I had experience in building websites and mobile apps. 
I am also able to write little script to automate manual tasks. 
I am currently looking for a software developer or technical role. 
If you need help in building a website, building an app or an alternative solution to some of the repetitive tasks, I am happy to help. 
Kind regards,
Binh
